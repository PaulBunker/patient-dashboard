# Patient Dashboard

This is a full-stack web application that lists patients belonging to a specific clinic, and allows users to sort the list by any field.

## Technologies Used

- Create React App: a tool for quickly setting up a React development environment, used to save time during development. Note that this approach may not be suitable for a real production app, and a different method may be used instead.
- TypeScript
- React
- Node.js
- Apollo Client: a state management library for JavaScript applications, used to fetch data from the backend
- Apollo Server: a GraphQL server library for Node.js, used to serve data to the frontend
- CSV Parse: a library for parsing CSV files
- Jest: a JavaScript testing framework used for unit testing.
- Testing Library: a library for testing React components.

### Notes

- The project requires at least Node.js version 18.16.0 to run. If you're using an older version of Node.js, the project and tests may not work as expected.
- Given more time I would separate the back end and front end more but I still like monorepo style architecture
